Curious, creative and a constant learner is how I would describe myself. 

My transition into a career in code is driven by my fascination to understand how tech works, how to extract the most from it and how to make it work better. This journey began with Ataris, Amigas and BBSs, building custom PCs, image and video manipulation using Adobe CS, making websites in Wordpress/HTML/CSS, 3D design and printing, hardware emulation, mobile apps and more. But until Makers, the one constant frustration was not knowing how to change or improve what goes on behind the scenes. Now after 16 intensive weeks of Ruby and JS I now feel I have the tools to match my tech enthusiasm and am looking forward to the next chapter to build upon what I have learnt. 

I have 20+ years experience as a Creative (Copywriter/Art Director) in the Advertising industry. My ability to generate ideas and solutions to business problems that make products and services easier to understand for consumers is my key strength. I've made ads of all shapes and sizes, but I've have also created websites, mobile games, apps and digital experiences too.

## Skills & strengths

#### Team Player

Most of my career in advertising has involved working together alongside another person as a creative duo, so when it came to pair programming on the Makers projects and tasks it felt quite a natural and normal experience. Even during the larger group projects I felt comfortable listening to other people's views and offering my opinion or putting forward ideas of my own on how we should approach a task. We applied agile ways of working in our group projects with morning standups, kanban boards and afternoon retros, again most of which I'm already used to from modern advertising working practises.

#### Empathy

One of the main skills you practise in advertising is putting your mind inside the mind of the consumer. This often helps you to break down complex information into simple, but meaningful messages that your audience will understand and resonate with. I also found this particularly true of coding too. I was always thinking about better method and class names that would best reflect and communicate the function of the code. During team projects I would also often comment on key lines in my code to help the other members of the group understand the purpose or flow of information. For me, coding is not just about solving a problems, it's about solving problems in a way that makes it easier for other people to contribute to your code and use the final product.
